## Topic definitions

- `local_models`: Model-artifact and local-hardware behavior on device: GGUF/quantization behavior, VRAM and hardware constraints, model-family quirks, local model UX/fallback, and local model context behavior. Engine integration itself belongs to `self_hosted_inference`.
- `inference_api`: The integration layer between OpenClaw and model serving/providers: usage of Responses, Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and similar inference APIs; streaming/SSE and usage chunks; base URL normalization; request/response handling for inference, including TTS, vision, and embeddings API integrations; and adding or configuring inference providers (setup, auth, routing, catalogs, compatibility).
- `self_hosted_inference`: Integration with inference engines such as vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, TGI, or LocalAI — whether on device or self-hosted elsewhere: engine setup, lifecycle, compatibility, engine crashes/timeouts, and self-hosted embeddings/speech/memory backends.
- `acpx`: ACPX protocol, transport, proxy, worker/backend process, configured binding, compatibility, and files or commands explicitly named ACPX.
- `acp`: ACP protocol features, ACP sessions, binding, parent/child behavior, and delivery semantics that are not necessarily ACPX-specific.
- `coding_agent_integrations`: Integrations with external coding agents in general, or with a specific coding agent such as Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or Pi. Internal OpenClaw subagents, `sessions_spawn` plumbing, ACP parent/child behavior, queue lanes, trace producers, tool-use mechanics, approval flows, sandboxing, compaction, and agent runtime machinery do not qualify unless the item is specifically about a coding-agent integration.
- `mcp_tooling`: MCP server or client behavior, MCP allow/deny rules, conformance checks, handshake/tool behavior, MCP config, tool discovery and materialization (tools/list and resources), and tool invocation compatibility.
- `model_lifecycle`: Introduction, decommissioning, or adjustment of model configurations: adding/removing/renaming model IDs, catalog and default updates, deprecations, version-specific model support, and model metadata (context windows, quantization variants) changes.
- `codex`: Items that explicitly involve the Codex runtime, Codex auth, Codex ACP, Codex plugin, or Codex command compatibility.
- `agent_runtime`: OpenClaw's internal agent machinery: runtime startup, loop, backends, model call orchestration, runtime adapter behavior, subagent execution and orchestration, and runtime ownership/execution architecture. External coding-agent integrations belong to `coding_agent_integrations`; ACP protocol/session/delivery work belongs to `acp`/`acpx`.
- `sessions`: Session identity, lifecycle, persistence, binding, transcript, resume, reset, cleanup, parent/child session behavior, and session stores.
- `gateway`: OpenClaw gateway behavior, daemon startup, HTTP gateway routes, gateway protocol, gateway restart, gateway state, gateway-owned execution, and service health.
- `exec_tools`: Shell execution, command invocation, PATH handling, exec tools, command allowlists, tool execution policy, execution output control, and durable process handling.
- `approvals`: Approval flows, permission decisions, approval prompts, approve/deny commands, approval mode behavior, policy checks, and pending approval state.
- `sandboxing`: Sandbox policy, sandbox inheritance, sandbox escape, path isolation, containers, Docker, process limits, filesystem hiding, and execution boundaries.
- `hooks`: Hook registration, hook lifecycle, hook events, hook priority, hook payloads, hook filtering, hook security, and managed hook behavior.
- `cron_automation`: Cron jobs, scheduled runs, heartbeat automation, one-shot jobs, force-run behavior, and recurring task execution.
- `chat_integrations`: Chat platform integrations, channel adapters, message ingestion, and delivery surfaces such as Discord, Telegram, Slack, Feishu, WhatsApp, Zulip, Mattermost, and webchat.
- `ui_tui`: User interface behavior as the changed or failing surface: UI/TUI display, interaction, navigation, rendering, dashboards, status views, footer, mobile UI, and settings screens. Not for defects merely observed through a UI when the failing behavior belongs to another surface.
- `browser_automation`: Browser automation, CDP/Chrome integration, browser session attach, auth browser flows, screenshots, browser vision, and web interaction tooling.
- `memory`: Memory systems, memory indexing/search, embeddings, vector stores, active memory, LanceDB, memory provider state, and memory archival or recovery.
- `security`: Security posture and boundaries: SSRF, private-network access, credential/auth boundaries, permissions, secret leakage, token handling, HMAC, sandbox escape, vulnerabilities, supply-chain hardening, and access control.
- `config`: Configuration as a surface: schemas, persisted config shape, config loading/validation/repair, defaults, environment variables, allow/deny configuration, policy settings, and adding or changing user- or operator-facing settings (toggles, pickers, defaults, persisted preferences), including when surfaced through a settings UI.
- `packaging_deployment`: Build, packaging, installers, Docker images, release artifacts, deployment, service managers, SEA, launchd, systemd, pnpm, and runtime distribution.
- `docs`: Documentation, guides, README changes, spelling, taxonomy, and explanatory content — when the documentation itself is the subject.
- `tests_ci`: Tests, CI, fixtures, coverage, mocks, and platform-specific test fixes — when test infrastructure itself is the subject.
- `telemetry_usage`: OpenClaw's own telemetry and usage surface: token/usage/cost accounting, metrics, diagnostics, trace production and observability coverage, and status reporting of the product. Not for measurement or benchmark vocabulary adjacent to another surface's change.
- `api_surface`: External API, CLI, HTTP, and SDK contracts: REST endpoints, webhooks, SSE, OpenResponses, chat completions, documented command contracts, and request/response shapes.
- `queueing`: Queues, lanes, task state, follow-up queues, scheduling, run ordering, work dispatch, locks gating dispatch, stuck jobs, and backpressure.
- `notifications`: Notification policy, completion delivery, delivery gates, notify settings, outbound messages, announcements, and sent-message handling.
- `skills_plugins`: Skills/plugins as product surfaces: SKILL.md, managed skills, plugin manifests/loading/registration, plugin SDK/runtime APIs, MCP Apps, plugin hooks, SecretRefs, skill sync/prelude/wrappers, and doctor/check behavior for plugin or skill surfaces (the bundled Policy plugin is a plugin surface).
- `auth_identity`: OpenClaw's own authentication and identity surface: login, auth profiles, OAuth flows, tokens, account binding, credential propagation, device identity, and credential scope within the product. Not for authentication of external services touched incidentally.
- `reliability`: Reliability behavior: timeouts, crashes, leaks, stuck state, retries, data loss, lifecycle cleanup, recovery, overload, races, and operational failure modes.
- `tool_calling`: Model tool-calling behavior: tool-call protocol, tool-call deltas, function/tool schemas, tool result transcript handling, tool result routing, and tool-call rendering.
