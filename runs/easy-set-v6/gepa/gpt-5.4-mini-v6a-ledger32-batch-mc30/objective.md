Improve only the mutable OpenClaw vanilla labeler routing policy.

The fixed AgentCard header, JSON output contract, schema enum, GitHub context renderer,
and allowed-topic taxonomy are not editable.

Primary objective: maximize row-aware GEPA score = 0.50*topic_micro_f1 + 0.20*row_exact_accuracy + 0.30*avg_row_jaccard. Do not optimize for recall-biased F-beta. Use precision, recall, exact match,
row Jaccard, row symdiff, cardinality, topic confusions, row examples, and
prompt-hygiene ASI to understand how to improve reliable row-level reproduction.

Keep the policy vanilla and compact. Prefer short reusable centrality/cardinality rules
over a long topic-by-topic rulebook.

Keep the mutable policy under 12,000 characters; over-budget policies receive a small
GEPA score penalty, so compress rules instead of accumulating exhaustive topic tables.

Preserve concise JSON-only behavior.

Do not copy, rewrite, reorder, rename, delete, extend, or replace the fixed allowed-topic
list, topic definitions, or cue/keyword list. Reference exact existing topic IDs only
when a concise reusable boundary rule needs them.

Do not include row IDs, issue numbers, exact titles, URLs, or copied examples. Do not add
memorized issue/title/keyword tables.

Do not include data-build notes, version-history commentary, teacher/adjudication
procedure, promotion rules, or confusion-bucket bookkeeping in the task policy.
